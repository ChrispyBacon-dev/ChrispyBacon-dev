> **"The best way to predict the future is to create it."**

I‚Äôm a tech enthusiast from Switzerland with 20+ years building and breaking things (mostly on purpose!). My passion for automation, self-hosting, and security drives my projects and open-source work. I‚Äôm always learning, always curious and always ready to solve hard problems.

## üöÄ Main Project

### [DockFlare](https://github.com/ChrispyBacon-dev/DockFlare) | [üåê Website](https://dockflare.app)

**DockFlare** is a powerful, self-hosted ingress controller that **automates Cloudflare Tunnel \& Zero Trust management** using Docker labels. DockFlare eliminates tedious manual configuration and centralizes access control for both Dockerized and non-Dockerized services.

- **Instant Public URLs:** From container to secure public access in seconds no Cloudflare dashboard needed.
- **Label-Driven Automation:** Configure ingress rules and Zero Trust security from your Docker compose files.
- **Centralized Web UI:** Intuitive dashboard to visualize tunnels, override access policies, monitor live logs, and manage manual rules.
- **Zero Trust Integration:** Apply per-service authentication and policy with simple labels or group templates.
- **Dynamic Event Handling:** DockFlare instantly reacts to Docker events and syncs with your Cloudflare account.
- **State Reconciliation:** Persistent state, graceful cleanup, and robust migration flows‚Äîdesigned for reliability.
- **Massive Community Adoption:**
    - ‚≠ê 1,600+ GitHub stars
    - 55,000+ Docker pulls
    - Used daily for modern homelab and multi-site deployments
